Using the example above, on the original due date you donâ€™t pay but instead roll over the 30-day, $1,000 loan for another 30 days. The rollover will add another $250 in finance fees, plus any other fees, to the amount you owe.
That $250 is added to the $1,250 you already owe, so now you owe $1,500, plus any other fees that the lender may charge for the rollover.
The rollover brings your cost of borrowing $1,000 for 60 days to at least $500.
